Dataset to run TREND function 

This file contains richness change values per cell obtained after runningMultilevel.RAR_EXTR.r (https://github.com/lgcarvalheiro/richness.change/blob/master/Multilevel.RAR_EXTR.r)
which were later used to run Trend.extractorV3 (https://github.com/lgcarvalheiro/richness.change/blob/master/Trend.extractorV3) and generate Figures published in
Carvalheiro et al. 2019 (doi: 10.1111/ecog.04656)

Note that bias due to differences in sampling effort is checked and corrected after running Trend.extractorV3, so this database is just an intermediate file and 
should not be used in other analyses or for plotting richness change values.
