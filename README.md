##Dataset to run TREND function 

This file contains richness change values per cell obtained after running Multilevel.RAR_EXTR.r (https://github.com/lgcarvalheiro/richness.change/blob/master/Multilevel.RAR_EXTR.r)
which were later used to run Trend.extractorV3 (https://github.com/lgcarvalheiro/richness.change/blob/master/Trend.extractorV3) and generate Figures published in
Carvalheiro et al. 2019 (doi: 10.1111/ecog.04656)

Note that bias due to differences in sampling effort is checked and corrected after running Trend.extractorV3, so this database is just an intermediate file and 
should not be used in other analyses or for plotting richness change values. 


For access to the original files (spatially and temporally explicit list of records) that were used to run Multilevel.RAR_EXTR.r please contact the authors.

##Dataset after running TREND function

This file provides the corrected richness change values per cell for different time periods comparisons. This file was used to generate Fig 2 and Fig 3 of  Carvalheiro et al. 2019 (doi: 10.1111/ecog.04656) and was used to run the analyses which generated Fig 4 of the same publication.
